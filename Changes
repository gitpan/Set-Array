        - Modified several methods to either handle or die on
          undefined values.  The following methods were changed:

        count - Counts undef elements if no args (or undef).
        delete - Dies if no arg (or undef).  Now takes a list,
           rather than a scalar, as an arg (though can still take
           a scalar, of course).
        delete_at - Dies if no start index supplied (or undef).
        exists - Now possible to test for existence of 'undef'.
        foreach - Dies if no arg supplied (or undef).
        index - If no arg (or undef), returns index of first
           occurrence of 'undef' value within array.
        indices - Dies if no arg supplied (or undef).
        join - Now defaults to comma if no value supplied.

        - Changed the 'splice' method so that its return values
        are consistent with the rest of the module.

        - Modified the 'sort' method so that it handles coderefs
        in the same manner as Perl's built-in 'sort' method (with
        the exception that the word 'sub' is required).  Thanks
        to Sean McAfee for the help.

        - Turned on the 'fallback' option for 'overload'.  This
        prevents errors for simple operations like "if($sao)", because
        I was accidentally using the overloaded operators in some
        cases where I meant to use the CORE operators.  Thanks to
        Terrence Brannon for the spot.
