- Patch sub indices() to accept more than 1 digit at each end of the range.
Hence not just '0..9' but now '0..99' '0..99999' etc are all supported.
Thanx to Georg Kipka for pointing out this problem.
I (Ron) found the same problem in the code for sub fill(). Also the docs for
fill() mistakenly used '3-5' as an example instead of '3..5'

Comments= <<EOT
- Incorporate the patch supplied by Marke with thanks. Now the method 'difference' returns
the objects in the difference and not the stingified versions of those objects.
Also Marke's test has been added to test.t.
Note: The undocument method 'complement' has not been updated. Email me suggestions if
o You know exactly what it ought to do
o How it differs from calling 'difference' with the $reversed flag set

Comments= <<EOT
- Switch maintainers from the original author Daniel Berger to Ron Savage
- Switch primary build method to Module::Build by adding a Build.PL and update Makefile.PL
- Patch subs intersection() and symmetric_difference() so they handle values == 0 which means
they now work for array indexes
- Patch sub flatten() to stop warnings like:
Using an array as a reference is deprecated at ... Array.pm line 227
- Clean up a couple of tests to make them run cleanly
- Add a final test for handling 0
- Add a POD test
- Put tests in t/

Comments= <<EOT
- Added 'duplicates()' method
- Added a 'sym_diff' alias for the 'symmetric_difference()' method.
- Added a 'contains' alias for the 'exists()' method.
- A few of the overloaded methods did not behave consistently with the
rest of the module when it came to void calling context. This has
been fixed.
- Removed a debug print statement that had been inadvertently left in
the 'symmetric_difference()' method. Oops. Thanks to Martin
Krzywinski for the spot.
- This file has been changed to show the most recent changes on the
top of the page. :)
- Minor POD fixes

Comments= <<EOT
- Fixed a bug with the 'unique' method. I had evaluated
contexts incorrectly causing it to fail when part of a
chain. Thanks to Steffen Muller for the spot.

- Fixed this archive a bit to expand a bit more properly

Comments= <<EOT
- Turned on the 'fallback' option for 'overload'. This
prevents errors for simple operations like "if($sao)" because
I was accidentally using the overloaded operators in some
cases where I meant to use the CORE operators. Thanks to
Terrence Brannon for the spot.

Comments= <<EOT
- Modified the 'sort' method so that it handles coderefs
in the same manner as Perl's built-in 'sort' method (with
the exception that the word 'sub' is required). Thanks
to Sean McAfee for the help.

Date=2001-09-26T16:00:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Modified several methods to either handle or die on
undefined values. The following methods were changed:
count - Counts undef elements if no args (or undef).
delete - Dies if no arg (or undef). Now takes a list
rather than a scalar as an arg (though can still take
a scalar of course).
delete_at - Dies if no start index supplied (or undef).
exists - Now possible to test for existence of 'undef'.
foreach - Dies if no arg supplied (or undef).
index - If no arg (or undef) returns index of first
occurrence of 'undef' value within array.
indices - Dies if no arg supplied (or undef).
join - Now defaults to comma if no value supplied.
