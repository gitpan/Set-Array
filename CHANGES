0.18  Wed Nov  5 09:45:00 2008
	  - Patch sub indices() to accept more than 1 digit at each end of the range.
	  	Hence not just '0..9', but now '0..99', '0..99999', etc are all supported.
		Thanx to Georg Kipka for pointing out this problem
	  - I (Ron) found the same problem in the code for sub fill(). Also, the docs for
		fill() mistakenly used '3-5' as an example, instead of '3..5'
	  - Clean up the documentation generally, particularly the as_hash() method
	  - Document that the to_hash() method is an alias for as_hash()
	  - Document that the symm_diff() method is an alias for symmetric_difference()
	  - Fix documentation for join($string), which used to say join($char)
	  - Add new tests for as_hash(), fill() and indices()
	  - Add Test::Deep to Build.PL and Makefile.PL, to support new tests for as_hash()

0.17  Fri Jul 25 09:40:00 2008
	  - Patch sub intersection again to properly handle 0 as a member of a set

0.16  Fri Jul 25 09:28:00 2008
	  - Arrrrgggggghhhhh. Patch t/test.t, to change the version number

0.15  Tue Jul 22 10:55:00 2008
	  - Patch sub intersection to fix RT#29871. Add corresponding test
	  - Rename Changes to Changes.txt to match my other modules
	  - Add Changelog.ini

0.14  Mon Apr 10 19:51:00 2006
	- Fix test which used a hard-coded version number

0.13  Sun Apr 09 13:58:00 2006
	- Incorporate the patch supplied by Marke, with thanks. Now the method 'difference' returns
		the objects in the difference, and not the stingified versions of those objects.
		Also, Marke's test has been added to test.t.
		Note: The undocument method 'complement' has not been updated. Email me suggestions if
		o You know exactly what it ought to do
		o How it differs from calling 'difference' with the $reversed flag set

0.12  Mon Jan 10 16:10:00 2005
	- Switch maintainers from the original author Daniel Berger to Ron Savage
	- Switch primary build method to Module::Build by adding a Build.PL, and update Makefile.PL
	- Patch subs intersection() and symmetric_difference() so they handle values == 0, which means
		they now work for array indexes
	- Patch sub flatten() to stop warnings like:
		Using an array as a reference is deprecated at ... Array.pm line 227
	- Clean up a couple of tests to make them run cleanly
	- Add a final test for handling 0
	- Add a POD test
	- Put tests in t/

0.11  Wed Feb 02 07:01:00 2004
        - Fixed bug in exists() method.  Thanks go to Rob Kinyon for the spot and
          the fix.
        - Fixed bug in the count() method.
        - Fixed bug in the delete() method.
        - Added a to_hash() alias for the as_hash() method.
        - Added more tests

0.10  Sun Jul 28 20:46:00 2002
        - Added 'duplicates()' method
	- Added a 'sym_diff' alias for the 'symmetric_difference()' method.
	- Added a 'contains' alias for the 'exists()' method.
	- A few of the overloaded methods did not behave consistently with the
	  rest of the module when it came to void calling context.  This has
	  been fixed.
        - Removed a debug print statement that had been inadvertently left in
	  the 'symmetric_difference()' method.  Oops.  Thanks to Martin
	  Krzywinski for the spot.
        - This file has been changed to show the most recent changes on the
	  top of the page. :)
        - Minor POD fixes

0.09  Fri Jun 21 11:22:00 2002
        - bag() method calling context issue fixed
        - The intersection() method (taken from the Cookbook) was broken.
	  It has been fixed.  Thanks to James Keenan for the spot.
	- Some minor POD fixes.

0.08  Fri Dec 21 09:00:00 2001
        - Modified 'is_equal' and 'not_equal' to deal with undef values
        - Stricter error checking in 'foreach' method
        - Added 'impose()' method
        - Added 'pack()' method
        - Added 'rindex()' method
        - Added the beginnings of a test suite
        - Fixed a major bug in the 'delete_at()' method (oops)
        - Renamed 'empty()' method to 'is_empty()'

0.07  Tue Nov 27 09:00:00 2001
        - Added the 'set()' method.  Thanks to Steffen Muller for the idea.
        - Created an alias called 'get()' for the 'indices()' method.
        - Fixed several methods that weren't handling '0' correctly.
        - Replaced 'die' with 'croak' throughout module.
        - Updated the docs.

0.06  Tue Nov 20 14:30:00 2001
        - Fixed a bug with the 'unique' method.  I had evaluated
        contexts incorrectly, causing it to fail when part of a
        chain.  Thanks to Steffen Muller for the spot.
        - Freed some memory that was being wasted in the unique method
        - Fixed this archive a bit to expand a bit more properly

0.05  Mon Oct 9 12:30:00 2001
        - Turned on the 'fallback' option for 'overload'.  This
        prevents errors for simple operations like "if($sao)", because
        I was accidentally using the overloaded operators in some
        cases where I meant to use the CORE operators.  Thanks to
        Terrence Brannon for the spot.

0.04  Fri Oct 5 12:00:00 2001
        - Modified the 'sort' method so that it handles coderefs
        in the same manner as Perl's built-in 'sort' method (with
        the exception that the word 'sub' is required).  Thanks
        to Sean McAfee for the help.

0.03  Tue Oct 2 08:00:00 2001
        - Changed the 'splice' method so that its return values
        are consistent with the rest of the module.

0.02  Wed Sep 26 16:00:00 2001
        - Modified several methods to either handle or die on
          undefined values.  The following methods were changed:

        count - Counts undef elements if no args (or undef).
        delete - Dies if no arg (or undef).  Now takes a list,
           rather than a scalar, as an arg (though can still take
           a scalar, of course).
        delete_at - Dies if no start index supplied (or undef).
        exists - Now possible to test for existence of 'undef'.
        foreach - Dies if no arg supplied (or undef).
        index - If no arg (or undef), returns index of first
           occurrence of 'undef' value within array.
        indices - Dies if no arg supplied (or undef).
        join - Now defaults to comma if no value supplied.
