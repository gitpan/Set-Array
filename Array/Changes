        - Modified several methods to either handle or die on
          undefined values.  The following methods were changed:

        count - Counts undef elements if no args (or undef).
        delete - Dies if no arg (or undef).  Now takes a list,
           rather than a scalar, as an arg (though can still take
           a scalar, of course).
        delete_at - Dies if no start index supplied (or undef).
        exists - Now possible to test for existence of 'undef'.
        foreach - Dies if no arg supplied (or undef).
        index - If no arg (or undef), returns index of first
           occurrence of 'undef' value within array.
        indices - Dies if no arg supplied (or undef).
        join - Now defaults to comma if no value supplied.
